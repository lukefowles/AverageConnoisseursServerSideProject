MVP: 
- Aim is to create an Resturant database/API which:
- Customers can create an account > create a customer table to store the customer 
- Customers can go through the criteria for selecting what type of resturant they want to go to > based on cuisine, dietrary, price, rating (average rating)
- Criteria class (customer search class) > acts the filters the database through**
- Customer can get a list of restaurants based on criteria 
- Customer can add restaurant to the database
- Customer can give a rating out 5 >>> all in the database > class will calculate and update (rating service class)
- Additional step > Customer can give review of the restaurant > separate database for both review and ratings 
- Restaurant class / Restaurant review class (call for the id) > can add review and ratings separately 
- Create a wishlist table for storing in the database 
- Customers can view their own wishlist > can also delete restaurants off their wishlists 

Extension to MVP: 
- Randomiser chooses restaurant for customer based on their criteria or no criteria whatsoever (lucky dip)
- Create a booking system for customers that allows them to book a restaurant for a certain day
- The program should be able to recognise when a restaurant ha exceeded its maximum customers for a given day
- Implement machine learning method for restaurant reccomendations
