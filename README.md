# AverageConnoisseursServerSideProject

We are the average connosseurs, a team consisting of BNTA cohort 4 members Aaishah, Jess, Luke and Yonis. For our server-side project we are creating an API which allows users to interact with a restaurant database in a variety of ways. This idea was inspired by the Food Recommendations channel in the cohort discord, and we hope to add cohort member's favourite restaurants to our sample database. Below are the key aims of our MVP.


##MVP

- Customers are able to create an account which is stored to the customer database.
- Customers are able to edit or delete their account.
- Customers are able to view restaurants and related information.
- Customers are able to filter restaurants according to criteria.
- Customers can order restaurants by average rating.
- Customers can add a restaurant to the database (We will also include functionality to edit and remove restaurants, this in practise would be for admins).
- Customers can review a restaurant, giving it a rating out of five and a comment. When review is added, the average rating of the restaurant should be recalculated.
- Customers have their own wishlist within the API, to include their favourite restaurants or restaurants they would like to go to. Customers can add and remove from the wishlist.
- Unit testing for service methods.

##Extension to MVP: 

If we have additional time, here are some more aims we would like to work on:

- Randomiser that chooses a restaurant for customers based on their criteria or no criteria whatsoever (lucky dip).
- Create a booking system for customers that allows them to book a restaurant for a certain day.
- The program should be able to recognise when a restaurant has exceeded its maximum customers for a given day.
- Add password functionality, so that only the relevant customer is able to edit/view their information.
- Implement machine learning method for restaurant reccomendations.
